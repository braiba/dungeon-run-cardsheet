Good,Spin to Win,Make one Melee attack to all creatures within range
Good,The stuff inside stretch armstrong,"the 80s were good to us a stretch armstrong doll that looks like mini Uggo appears in front of you. You pull his arms but unfortunately breaks apart and purple ooze explodes from him. Is it good? Is it evil? Let the dice decide. Rolla D6. 1-3 Evil = damage, 4-6 Good = healing."
Good,You See Nothing,"When you or a party member fails their Stealth check, you have an opportunity to roll a DC15 intimidation check instead so that the NPC sees nothing."
Good,Power of the Lodestar,"Want to crush your enemies but good, use a Lodestar. Call upon the stars and channel your inner chi to drop a Lodestar upon your enemies. That's right, roll well enough and you throw an entire tower from the sky at your enemy. Roll 4 D20 in the box. If you roll doubles of any number double the combined total for force damage, triple for triples and 4x if you roll all four the same number. "
Good,Just in Queso,"You are infused with the strength of the mythical Cheese Cat. The next time your advantage is countered by a disadvantage, gain 5 temporary hit points."
Good,"Never Give Up, Never Surrender","The amulet will not let you give anything else but your best. On your next DMG roll, roll your hit die until you roll the highest possible roll (if it is a d8, until you roll an 8). Count how many times you have to roll until you get it, and add that number to your DMG."
Good,The Fibon-ouchy Numbers,"1  1  2  3  5  8  13

When you roll one of the numbers above on an attack roll, you may cross that number out to deal 1d4 psychic damage to the target, even if the attack missed."
Evil,Smash!,Next time you fall prone an overwhelming force smashes you with ogreish might.  You take 2d10 bludgeoning damage.  Now you know how the clam...and the Achaierai rider felt.
Good,"The Power of Might, Power of Right","Perform a combination move with the player closest to you both rolling dice together for hit and then damage - taking the highest to use as your rolls.  If at any point you two rolled the same number, add a D6 of additional damage for this righteous combo move!"
Good,Standing Out in the Crowd,"There are so many dice to roll, but only certain numbers immediately catch your eye. Grab as many dice as you can fit in your hands and roll them. Count how many max (20 on a d20, 12 on a d12, etc.) and 1 rolls you get. Add the number of max rolls to a DMG roll, or use the number of 1 rolls as healing.  You may decide after rolling."
Good,My 19 Page Character Backstory,"The next time an enemy attacks you, shout ""But have you read my 19 page character backstory?!"".  You hand that enemy a copy and make them read it.  They skip the next round of combat, but can attack you for double damage after that, because they read about all your weaknesses."
Good,The sneer of disdain.,"You sneer 'You'll have to do better than that!' as you bat away any one physical hit in combat. Your attacker has one chance to roll a natural 20, otherwise the attack misses."
Good,The mighty snort of Derision!,Triggers if your enemy fails to hit you.  Your snort of derision is so loud he gets a complex. His attacks on anyone the next round are at disadvantage. If he fails to hit again he makes DC 16 Wis save or attempts to flee.
Good,Pinball Bumper,One reaction is just not enough. You're bouncing like a pinball bumper and get a reaction attack to every attack on you and movement past you for this round. By the next round you're worn out and get no reaction and half movement.
Evil,Curse of the endermen,"Your movement speed becomes 0, and at the beginning of your next turn, randomly teleport 30ft in a direction determined by a 1d4 roll.  1=up, 2=down, 3=left, 4=right."
Good,"Well, Actually...","Roll two D20s and record the results. As a reaction, any single time a D20 is rolled during tonight's session, say ""Well, Actually..."" and replace the roll with one of your two recorded rolls. This can affect ANY roll, including Jeffs."
Evil,Oh No! There Were Strings Attached!,"That free gold you got? It had been stolen from a fey. And they’re angry. Next combat, whenever a party member takes damage, they also lose that much gold. If you run out of gold, take an extra point of damage for every 5 gold you’re short by."
Good,Re-Action,"You may use a force card as a reaction, even if it would normally be an action to use. "
Good,Stronger Together,"A dagger appears in your pack, which you can use as a bonus action. Roll a D6 and write the result on the card. Add the result to the regular 1d4 attack of the dagger. The dagger now slips from you and into another member's pack (determine by roll). They add a 2nd number to the card, increasing damage further. Repeat. The dagger disappears when all party members have attacked with it at least once, or when any two numbers on the card are the same."
Good,A little instruction please?,"You're really not sure how to do this, it just isn't your thing. But you know who's actually good at it, maybe they'll help just this once. Have another character make one skill or ability check for you using their roll and modifiers. No card help for them."
Good,This one matters! Quiet please!,"This roll is a make or break. It matters! Before Jeff tells you whether you have advantage or disadvantage on this roll, announce you're using this card. You focus with a laser intensity on the job at hand and roll in the box with advantage. All other distractions fade away and all disadvantages from any source or condition fade away and are disregarded."
Good,Lord ArraBanhammer,A creature of your choice said something you didn't like in chat and gets muted for 1 round. Lay down the Ban Hammer!
Good,Meep's Revenge,"As like Meep was attacked in Shantytown so is one enemy of your choice. As a bonus action, 3 magic missiles fly out of the amulet at any enemy of your choice dealing 1d4 +1 damage per missle, and as each missile hits it creates the sound ""Meep""."
Good,Elephant of Surprise,"Next time you start combat, you may activate this card. An elephant falls from the sky, and lands on one enemy of your choice. The target takes 2d4 bludgeoning damage, and if the target's size is medium, or smaller they are also knocked prone."
Good,Force of Evi.. Hey wait a second,"A force of evil pops out the amulet when it should have been good, the amulet apologizes for this and makes the force of evil effect your enemies instead. draw a force of evil card and apply it to an enemy of your choice."
Good,Jeff needs solidarity,"Jeff is tired of being the only one left out so for the next ENTIRE COMBAT all the players must roll with their left hand.  If the DM catches you tolling with your right hand, you will have to re-roll that dice with disadvantage. We lefties have to stick together!"
Good,Bardic Boombox,"As a bonus action, a magical boombox appears in your hands, playing ""All the Bingle ladies"", the hit song by Beach-yansay Gnomes. Anyone within 20' of the boombox can receive bardic inspiration. Ladies, put your hands up, cause you can also add a D6 of damage to your attack this round."
Good,"That's my Secret, I'm Always Angry","Triggers the next time Uggo rages in combat. While Uggo rages, all players get +2 to their attack rolls, so long as Uggo continues to rage. However, once Uggo stops raging, he takes damage equal to the number of rolls this effected.  Keep track on the card."
Good,Digits widget,Conjure a pair of magical mithril knuckles to equip on digit for one round. Digit can make a single punch attack. Damage is magical and deals 1d10 bludgeoning.
Good,Dire Straits,"Think you’re a sultan of swing? That you should get money for nothing?

Fine.

The next to-hit roll you fail, re-roll it. If you succeed, you’ll find 20 gold in your back pocket.

Also if Fahima looks puzzled or doesn’t get the reference, someone must sing ""I want my MTV..."" to her or you must give the money back."
Good,Meditation Motivation,"A sudden calm washes over you. Through the amulet, and in this quiet moment, you feel a sense of relief as you realize that you are loved and that your place in the world matters. With this meditation as your action, you gain the effects of a short rest, even in the midst of battle."
Evil,Let’s Make a Deal,"Your rolls aren’t great, at best mediocre,
But I’ve got a deal that I’m willing to broker.
You’ve got a good healer, & HP aplenty,
Speak a number aloud, as much as to 20.
Whatever you choose, is the damage as toll, That number replaces your next awesome roll."
Evil,Ethereal Echo,"DO NOT SAY ALOUD UNTIL IT HAPPENS The next time a spell or card effect is cast by the party meant to cause damage to anything in combat and succeeds, the holder of this card rolls 1d6. If a 1 or 2 the damage is prevented, 3 or 4 the damage hits but also equally damages the caster, if 5 or 6 the damage hits but equally damages the whole party."
Evil,Minor Illusion of Disadvantage,"This card triggers the next time you make a skill check or attack roll with advantage.  You imagine multiple ways to fail at what you're doing and become momentarily frightened.  Instead of rolling a d20, roll 4d10 and add up the two lowest values as your roll. You do not remain frightened after the roll."
Evil,The Devil You Know,"At the start of the next combat, roll 2d6.  Every party member will take that damage. After rolling, you may decide to discard this FOE and not take the damage in exchange for 2 new FOE cards. What's worse, the devil you know or the devil you don't?"
Good,Going Out in a Blaze of Glory!,"Your friends are being overwhelmed, they just can't take the attacks coming at them! Time to step up and intervene. You shout 'It's me you want!' and all enemies within 100' must make a DC18 Wis save or attempt to attack only you for the next round."
Good,Warden Colors,"Do you remember which PRIMARY color was NOT a Warden color?
  - If yes, get an extra D4 piercing damage on your next attack.

Do you remember the color you chose for your Warden?  Each member who remembers correctly, get an extra D4 of damage the next time they attack."
Good,Don't @ Me,"If you're tired of the haters, swing this handy block-chain in the air as a reaction to deflect one ranged attack directed at you (physical or magical, but not AoE) at another target you can see. On a DC12 check (no modifiers) it hits your target, otherwise it lands elsewhere hitting nothing."
Good,Do You Feel Me Now? Feel My Pain!,You may take as much self inflicted damage as you chose of any type of damage YOU can do up to your maximum hit points. Any one enemy within 60' takes the same amount. No saves or mitigation from any source for either you or the enemy.
Good,Dead Eye,Your perception is heightened. Its as if you can sense where the weak points are on the enemy. On your next ranged attack deal a extra 1d8 of damage
Good,Tag Team,"Pick a player. For duration of combat, regardless of position, if either of you get an opportunity attack against an opponent, you both get it. If movement is needed, you’re magically teleported to the enemy without invoking an opp attack against you and then teleported back to your original location. You must high 5 each time you tag the other player in."
Good,DM Stalling Tactics,Do not read aloud until complete. Jeff suddenly rolls several dice behind his screen and looks at the party menacingly. Roll 5 d20s.  Keep any 19 or 20 rolled for future use against the party in encounters.
Good,Move-mint,"You eat a small candy that freshens your breath and tastes of butterscotch and mint, gain a second move action."
Good,Dungeon Run Merch,"A strange but familiar garment appears on your body, and you feel awesome. Describe which Dungeon Run shirt you're wearing to gain +2 to AC until the end of combat."
Evil,Gloom and Blind.  Be both.,"Darkness descends, clouding your vision and your mind in an existential fog as you question whether or not what you've put out into the world has made it a better place.  You're blind and roll with disadvantage for one round of combat, until you recall you love loving things and the fog lifts."
Evil,Meep come to me,Meep thinks you are in trouble and flies to you. Problem is meep didn't have good depth perception and crashed right in to you dealing 1 d6 fire damage and knocking you prone.
